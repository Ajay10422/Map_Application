# MapMap

* It is a Progressive Web Application Â 
* Pathfinding, often used in computer applications, involves finding the shortest route between two points and is a practical approach to solving mazes. This field of  study relies heavily on A* or Dijkstra's algorithm, which calculates the shortest path in a weighted graph. It is closely linked to the shortest path problem in graph theory, where the goal is to determine the path that optimally fulfills certain criteria, such as being the shortest, most cost-effective, or quickest route, between two points within a complex network.
